## Features

## Checklist Specifications

- [x] Use [Trending Movies API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/trending-movies) to get the trending movies for today and create an infinite list (query the next page as it scrolls)
- [x] This should work offline after first use by caching the results, the  cache should persist between application sessions and device reboots results
- [x] The movie list item should include an image, movie title, year and vote average
- [x] Add a search field and allow searching movies using [Search Movie API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/search-movie), when the search field is empty go back to showing the trending movies (search doesnâ€™t need to work offline)
- [x] Present a detail view when a movie is tapped. Get info for the view using [Movie Details API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/movie-details).  Also cache this detail info to make it work off-line for any items that were previously queried and viewed.

### Extra points:

- [x] Create Unit Tests.
- [x] Create a simple UI Test.
- [x] Make search work offline by searching cached results.
- [x] Error message handling (offline/online/failed API calls).
